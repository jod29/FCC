## Solutions

I downloaded the solutions to some of the challenges from freecodecamp for reference purposes. I tend to forget much of what I did if I do not do it often enough. Many times, I know what to do with the solution to the challenge, but I cannot seem to translate my thoughts to Javascript code. If I have these solutions nearby, maybe, I could shorten the solving time.
